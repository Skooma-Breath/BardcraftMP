  theroadbehindus.mid:
    title: The Road Behind Us
    description: A simple air, purportedly of Breton origin, much like one you'd hear as the embers die low in a Shornhelm inn. A tune for when the grand tales have been told, the boasts are quieted, and all that's left is the warmth of the hearth and the silent thoughts of a road well-traveled.
